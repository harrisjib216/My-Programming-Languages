# Various Attempts to Make Programming Languages

## Intro
I'm quite interested in 🧔🏾‍♂️🤝🏾 human languages and 🖥️ 0️⃣1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ machine languages.
It would great if I knew spoke them all.
But I don't, and cannot. *Sigh* I must pick only some of them 😞

One day I will make a language to have a great balance of speed, portability, and cool factor

Until then, I'll be adding my experiments as I gain experience
